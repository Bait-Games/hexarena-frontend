As a general guideline, the client should do as much work for the server as it can, but without compromising security.

Clients SHOULD send to the server a message that their player moved in one of the 8 cardinal directions.
Clients SHOULD NOT send more than one movement message per tick
    e.g. Clients should send UP_RIGHT, not UP and RIGHT
         Clients should send RIGHT, not RIGHT and RIGHT
